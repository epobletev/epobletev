### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Emilio!
I'm a developer (or I hope so!), I consider myself a self-taught person, which is why my actual goal is improve and learn the most I can in my professional and personal life, Searching and learning new technologies.
Also I seek to learn of my peers with most experience every moment I can.
Currently learning Javascript, focusing in the frameworks NodeJS and ReactJS.
I also like to read manga.
